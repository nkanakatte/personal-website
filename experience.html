                <p>I started my career as a Junior Java Programmer in a startup about 20 years ago. This job gave me a
                    good foundation in Java programming. We were building a product for the garment industry and doing
                    all the coding using EditPlus.</p>
                <article class=" container">
                    <p>After working at the start up for 18 months, I got the opportunity to work as a project
                        Assistance at the Indian Institute of
                        Science (<a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" class="a-general" target="_blank">IISc</a>), a famous and
                        one of the top educational and research institutes of the world. I was building an <a
                            href="http://brahmi.sourceforge.net/" class="a-general" target="_blank">editor</a> for
                        Kannada (a South Indian Language), managing websites and other solutions as part of a Government
                        program to promote Indian Languages in Information technology.</p>

                    <p>My first big break came in May 2004, at a software consulting startup, Iteamic. It was this
                        company that changed my future. I worked for this company for 9 years in different roles and got
                        an opportunity to work for fortune 500 companies. In 2007, I was assigned to a strategic account
                        of Iteamic, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University. In 2012, I moved to the US to work
                        as Onsite Delivery Manager for <a href="https://www.ciber.com/" class="a-general"
                            target="_blank">Ciber</a>(acquired Iteamic in 2008) and later in 2013 joined Stanford
                        University as a Software Architect/Project Manager.</p>
                    <p>Over the last 20 years of professional
                        experience, I have held several roles across different organizations. </p>
                    <p>I have primarily been a Java programmer building enterprise applications using Spring and
                        Hibernate. However, over the years, I have also added PHP, Drupal, and Salesforce into my
                        technical basket. I have also worked on RDBMS. Refer to my detailed resume <a
