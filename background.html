                <p>Bengaluru, the Garden City, Silicon Valley of India is a wonderful city in the southern state of
                    Karnataka. I am proud to call it my birthplace. Back in the late '70s, with no internet and the
                    advent of cable TV, I had a great time growing up with my friends playing cricket, biking, and tons
                    of local sports. </p>

                <p>I did all my education in Bengaluru and ended the journey with an Engineering Degree in Industrial
                    Engineering &amp; Management. After having worked in manufacturing for 3 months, I decided that I
                    didn't
                    enjoy it and was drawn into Computers. I did a course in C, C++, Java, and Linux for a year and was
                    ready to try my luck but Universe had a different plan. It was the .com bubble time and I had to
                    struggle to find a job. It was in May 2001, 18 months after my graduation I started as a Junior Java
                    programmer, thanks to the job reference from a friend.

                <p>20 years later, here I am as working as an Engineering Manager and I couldn't have been more proud of
                    myself. Not to forget the guidance, support, and wishes of all my family, friends, co-workers, and
                    the blessings of God Almighty.</p>
